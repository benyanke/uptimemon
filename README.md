# uptimemon - Simple Service Monitoring in Bash

I guess something has to go here at some point


## Todo
### Short term
 * Clean up logging - it's currently a mess
 * Only output errors to slack - clean up that output too

 * 

### Long Term:
 * Add dashboard functionality - query the script to find site health
